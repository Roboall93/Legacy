Things to do:
~Fix project upload template (sort of)
#Add checking for preference assignment
#	- Duplicate rankings
#	- Same project
#	- 2 projects from 1 supervisor - write a function!
#Write test data
Consider implementation of admin interface
#Consider stages (Setup, upload, preference, assignment, etc)
	- django-solo module not working

#Add fields for project and supervisor capacity


Project notes:
Design


Fixes:
#Add supervisor identifier to project (just charField?)
#- Then finsh supervisor checker algorithm
#Delete database and rewrite pop script with new field values
#Look up example admin panels for syntax
Look up CSS box model and dividing page into segments
Try putting links in the navbar

#Project foreignkey refers back to supervisor (wrong way round currently)

Mention adding 'approved' segment for projects to filter and allow admin approval (after admin panel up)
